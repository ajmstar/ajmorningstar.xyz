                    <h2>Product &amp; Technology</h2>
                    <p>
                        I've always loved <strong>technology</strong> and been an early adopter (I 
                        joined Twitter in early 2008, and Facebook in late 2007). 
                        In college I studied <strong>statistics</strong>, primarily focused on 
                        computational applications, such as PCA, time-series 
                        analysis (e.g., GARCH, SARIMA), and ML (e.g., XGBoost, 
                        ensemble / bootstrap) and cofounded the <strong>Data Science Club</strong>. 
                        But I've never exactly been "technical" in my career, so 
                        I've always tried to stay abreast on technical concepts and 
                        emerging developments (for example, what is currently going 
                        on in the <strong>artificial intelligence value chain</strong>, and the 
                        importance of Kubernetes in AI deployment, and the shift to 
                        mobile-first that started around 2014). 
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        A few years ago I read <em>The Mythical Man Month</em> by Frederick Brooks, 
                        which gave me foundational insights into <strong>engineering management principles</strong> like resource allocation, product scoping, and technical debt tradeoffs.
                        At PwC I became involved in managing several internal products, working with <strong>technical product managers</strong> and engineering teams to ship internal tools, which I sincerely enjoyed.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Cinema / Motion Picture Business</h2>
                    <p>
                        I have a passion for <strong>cinema</strong> (especially indie) and 
                        eventually want to work in the industry in a tech / 
                        strategic capacity. I've been an avid indie moviegoer since 
                        high school (shoutout to The Palm Theater in my hometown of 
                        San Luis Obispo for curating a great selection over many 
                        years, and for being the first solar-powered movie theater 
                        in North America!).
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I read <em>Adventures in the Screen Trade</em> by William 
                        Goldman in 2019 after Aaron Sorkin talked about it in an 
                        interview with Marc Maron, and shortly thereafter I started 
                        following <strong>the trades</strong>, which has given me a great 
                        understanding of the <strong>film business</strong> and the tectonic shifts 
                        currently taking place in the industry. I went to <strong>Sundance 
                        2020</strong> without any tickets (yes, just a few short weeks before COVID lockdown) 
                        and saw 15 feature-length movies in four days during the first 
                        weekend. I had an incredible time: the moviegoing, the 
                        manic aura of festival buzz (around deals and acclaim), and 
                        the chats both extended and in-passing with so many industry 
                        professionals. I also received accreditation to <strong>Cannes</strong> in 
                        2020, but I wasn't able to go because of COVID, and 
                        subsequently became too busy with work to redeem the 
                        deferral the festival provided for later years<sup><a href="https://ajmorningstar.xyz/career-interests#footnote1">1</a></sup>.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        At <strong>Stern</strong>, I've pursued a specialization in <strong>film business</strong>, 
                        and luckily I'll be going to <strong>Cannes 2026</strong> as part of that 
                        program. In classes, I've taken advantage of the opportunity 
                        to deeply explore the <strong>motion picture value chain</strong>, from 
                        producing and financing to marketing and distribution.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Film Producing &amp; Financing Project</h3>
                    <p>
                        As part of my <strong>film business coursework</strong>, I led a team project 
                        developing a comprehensive production plan for a hypothetical sports
                        drama about Cuban baseball player defections. This 
                        project allowed me to apply strategic thinking across the 
                        entire <strong>film value chain</strong>, with special focus on the development and production process:
