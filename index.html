                <p>Welcome to my corner of the internet. I'm a <strong>full-time MBA student</strong> based in <strong>New York City</strong> (which I consider to be home). I am an <strong>aspiring product manager</strong>.</p>
                
                <p>As a person, my guiding principle is to be relentlessly engaged with the world. To me, this has meant constantly learning and exploring new topics in-depth
                with genuine interest and curiosity. When learning, I love to synthesize and structure what I have learned into simple frameworks or mental models—understanding 
                the essential components of any given problem space as well as subtle complexities that experts in a field would consider more thoughtfully.</p>
                
                <p>This site is where I share my extracurriculars, thoughts, and things I've found interesting. Feel free to explore

                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>I'm originally from <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/San+Luis+Obispo,+CA/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: #8e6db8; text-decoration: none;" aria-label="San Luis Obispo, California location on Google Maps">San Luis Obispo, California</a>—or <strong>SLO</strong> (pronounced like "slow")—a small town about 
                    halfway between LA and SF on the coast (I always tell people if you've driven South on the iconic Highway 1 segment through Big Sur, my hometown is where you popped up at the end near Hearst Castle). I didn't originally plan on going 
                    to college in my hometown, but three things drew me to <strong>Cal Poly</strong>:</p>
                    
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong><em>The financial aid package</em></strong> was too good to pass up (I had nearly a full-ride via grants and scholarships)</li>
                        <li><strong><em>Outcome-centered, highly-focused education</em></strong> through "learn-by-doing" on the quarter system would give me concrete skills to succeed in finance 
                        (also, all majors at Cal Poly are declared upon admission, meaning I spent all four years digging deep on finance)</li>
                        <li><strong><em>STEM focus and ethos</em></strong> of the university—my undergrad degree is a bachelor of science; Cal Poly's core curriculum is more heavily skewed towards math and science than other universities—
                        I also just liked being around engineers who built cool things</li>
                    </ol>

                    <p>In college, I studied <strong>finance and statistics</strong>, and had a nagging desire to work in data science to be at the nexus of tech and strategy. Throughout all four years, I worked 20-40 hours a week in food service and as a teaching assistant 
                    to afford basic expenses. Ultimately, I set my eyes on a career in finance, and went to work at <strong>PwC</strong> as a <strong>Deals Advisory Consultant</strong> in San Francisco from 2017-2020.</p>

                    <h2>2017-2020 — PwC Deals Advisory</h2>
                    <p><strong>My role at clients:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Consultant:</strong> held workshops with pre-IPO senior management, delivered PowerPoint decks to Boards of Directors outlining key considerations</li>
                        <li><strong>Financial Analyst:</strong> built financial models for complex items like amortization and stock-based compensation, as well as divestiture allocations and go-forward model</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p><strong>My role within PwC:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Strategist / Product Marketer:</strong> supported re-branding of PwC IPO services, including (1) competitive analysis (2) account prioritization and engagement strategy and (3) development of GTM decks / web marketing</li>
                        <li><strong>Improver:</strong> built tools in Alteryx, as well as internal templates used by thousands of users</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>In 2021 I moved to <strong>New York City</strong>. I changed groups to "<strong>Capital Markets Advisory - Equity</strong>", an elite team of only 4-5 people focused on providing investment-banking advice to pre-IPO clients. The team did not "build the book" or execute the 
                    sale of clients' shares, but was purely focused on advising on that process. Rather than taking a percentage of IPO fundraising, we were paid on a fixed-fee basis.</p>

                    <p><strong>My role at clients:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Investment Banker:</strong> performed valuation and modeling (comps, 3-statement, go-forward financial model for sell-side and earnings guidance), drafting the "box" and business section of the S-1, providing guidance on which 
                        hedge-funds to target in fundraising</li>
                        <li><strong>Investment Bank Consultant:</strong> determined which banks and lawyers should run the IPO, and how much they should be paid</li>
                        <li><strong>Investor Relations Consultant:</strong> drafted presentations and documents, e.g., quarterly earnings, investor days, non-deal roadshows</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p><strong>My role within PwC:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Product Manager:</strong> managed markets-focused dashboards and APIs used across the firm, led development of several key internal tools</li>
                        <li><strong>FP&A Manager:</strong> led budget planning and monthly / quarterly reporting processes</li>
                        <li><strong>Strategist:</strong> drove special projects (dotted-line to PwC Board of Directors)</li>

                    <h2>2023-Present — The Decision to Pivot via Business School</h2>
                    <p>In the summer of 2023, as the IPO market hit record lows of activity, I decided it was time to step back. I felt that I'd spent enough time in the advisor role, and knew I didn't want to be an investor. I spent my time traveling, running, 
                    visiting family, re-reading <em>The Power Broker</em>, and studying for the GRE and CFA Level 2 exams. In the process, I was soul-searching to figure out my next career move.</p>
                    <p>I ultimately pursued a <strong>full-time MBA at NYU Stern</strong> on full merit scholarship to build a long-term network in NYC and focus on exploring interests in <strong>product management</strong>, <strong>film business</strong>, and <strong>sustainability</strong>.</p>
